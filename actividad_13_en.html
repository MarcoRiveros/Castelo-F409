  <h1>Activity 13: Calle de las Sombrillas, or "Street of the Umbrellas - Cartagena</h1>
  <img src="images/img13.jpg" alt="Street of the Umbrellas" />
  <p>13- Narrow Alley - Umbrella Street, Cartagena. Previously known as Callejón Angosto, this is undoubtedly one of the narrowest alleys in Getsemaní. In recent years, it has taken on a new look with the help of an old accessory - the umbrella. Being the first place in Colombia to adopt this style, the alley was renamed Calle de las Sombrillas, becoming one of the most Instagrammable spots in Cartagena. The combination of hanging umbrellas, colorful houses, and urban art makes it undoubtedly one of the most picturesque locations in the city, especially when illuminated at night. The umbrellas turned out to be a welcome addition both artistically and practically, as they provide much-needed shade during the midday heat, as well as protection from the rain for pedestrians.</p>
