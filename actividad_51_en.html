  <h1>Activity 51: Visit the San Felipe de Barajas Castle - Cartagena -</h1>
  <img src="images/img51.jpg" alt="San Felipe de Barajas Castle" />
  <p>51-  Visiting the Castillo de San Felipe de Barajas is like taking a journey back in time, to an era when Cartagena de Indias was one of the main ports of the Spanish Crown in the Americas. Its strategic location and the constant flow of riches made it a coveted target for pirates, privateers, and enemies from other nations, who attacked and besieged it on multiple occasions. Exploring its tunnels is a sensory experience: the echoes of ancient footsteps still resonate through the passageways built more than four centuries ago; the limestone that forms the fortress feels cool to the touch. From the Hornabeque Battery, where the flag flies, visitors can enjoy a privileged view of the walled city embraced by the Caribbean Sea. It is also an ideal spot to take in one of Cartagenaâ€™s most beautiful and iconic sunsets.</p>
