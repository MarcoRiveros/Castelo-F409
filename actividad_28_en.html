  <h1>Activity 28: La Popa Hill - Cartagena -</h1>

  <p>28- La Popa Hill is the highest point in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, offering one of the best panoramic views of the city. When the Spanish arrived in 1510, they were amazed to see what appeared to be a large galley rising from the sea, which led them to name it «Cerro de la Galera» -Hill of the Galley-, with its summit referred to as the «Popa», reminiscent of the stern of a ship. Over time, locals also called it Cerro de la Cruz -Hill of the Cross-, due to the large cross that crowns the top. At the summit, visitors can find a beautiful colonial-era church and convent, from where you can enjoy stunning views of the walled city, the bay, and the surrounding areas. This historic site is perfect for a cultural and photographic getaway, offering both spiritual significance and natural beauty.</p>
