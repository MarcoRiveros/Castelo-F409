  <h1>Activity 12: Rosario Islands - Cartagena</h1>

  <p>12- Although many refer to it as -Barú Island-, it is actually a peninsula, bordered by the Bay of Cartagena, the Canal del Dique, and the Caribbean Sea. It’s known for its striking white and pink sand, as well as the crystal-clear waters that let you see all the way to the sea floor. Nearby, you’ll find mangrove-lined waterways, mirror-like lagoons, and stunning underwater gardens. Barú offers a variety of beaches, with the most popular being Playa Blanca, Cholón, Agua Azul, and Agua Tranquila. Playa Blanca is the largest and, as the name suggests, features bright sand that contrasts beautifully with the turquoise waters. It also has a wide range of food options. Cholón is only accessible by boat. The beach itself is small, but the real experience is anchoring your boat or yacht, soaking up the sun, listening to music, and mingling with other visitors. It's the place to “see and be seen.” Be sure to ask for prices before ordering food or drinks. In contrast, Agua Azul and Agua Tranquila offer a more peaceful experience. These beaches are perfect for relaxing, lounging on a sun chair — or right on the sand — and enjoying the calm and beauty of the surroundings.</p>
