  <h1>Activity 41: The Las Bóvedas Market of Cartagena</h1>

  <p>41-The Market of Las Bóvedas in Cartagena: This impressive building, with 47 arches and 23 domes, and its vibrant yellow facade, is impossible to miss. Las Bóvedas was the last section built of Cartagena's fortification system. Connected to the city walls, it was originally constructed to store ammunition, later serving as a shelter for troops in case of attack, and eventually becoming a prison. Today, the days when Las Bóvedas were used as dungeons are long gone. The building now houses the Las Bóvedas Market, where the former prison cells have been transformed into souvenir shops offering a wide range of classic Colombian souvenirs. Here, you can find mochilas, hammocks, magnets, small Botero statues, and traditional Colombian clothing.</p>
