  <h1>Activity 27: The Caribbean Iguana in Cartagena</h1>
  <img src="images/img27.jpg" alt="Iguana" />
  <p>27- In Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, iguanas are an important and iconic part of the local wildlife. The most commonly seen species are the green iguana (Iguana iguana) and the Caribbean iguana (Iguana delicatissima), often found in forested areas as well as near urban zones. These large reptiles are herbivores, feeding exclusively on fruits and leaves. They spend most of their day in the trees searching for food. Like other lizards, iguanas have a fascinating defense mechanism—if caught by the tail, they can detach it to escape, and over time, grow a new one. Unfortunately, iguanas also face threats from hunting, as both their meat and eggs are sought after in some areas. Despite this, spotting an iguana in its natural habitat remains a unique and memorable experience for visitors looking to connect with Cartagena’s vibrant biodiversity.</p>
