  <p>32- Discover the Magic of the National Aviary of Cartagena! Come and enjoy an unforgettable experience at one of the most impressive bird sanctuaries in the Americas. The National Aviary of Colombia is an ambitious project created to showcase the incredible diversity of birdlife found in the country. Spanning 7 hectares, it's the largest aviary in the Americas and the sixth largest in the world, home to over 1,800 birds from 138 different species. Truly breathtaking! Be amazed by the majestic Andean condor, Colombia’s national bird, and admire a rainbow of tropical species like the scarlet macaws, the vibrant green jay, and the stunning blue-winged tanager. Obsessed with the retro tropical vibe of flamingos? You’re in luck — there’s an entire flamboyance of them waiting for you. But the park isn’t just about birds. It also offers a rich display of Colombia’s native flora and fauna, playing a key role in conservation and environmental education, especially for endangered species. It’s the perfect half-day trip for everyone — kids love it, bird lovers are fascinated, nature enthusiasts are inspired, and content creators find endless photo ops. In short, it’s a must-see for all!</p>
