  <p>11-When people talk about Cartagena, Getsemaní always comes up — one of the city’s most tourist-friendly neighborhoods, known for its vibrant street art that captivates travelers. During colonial times, Getsemaní was home to many enslaved people forcibly brought from the African continent, especially West Africa, to the port of Cartagena. This historic and bohemian neighborhood is characterized by its narrow, alley-like streets, each with its own name and unique charm. Throughout the area, you’ll find cultural spots, delicious food, boutique hotels, and of course, plenty of lively nightlife.</p>
