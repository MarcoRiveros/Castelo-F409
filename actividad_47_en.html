  <h1>Activity 47: Traditions and Folklore in Cartagena</h1>
  <img src="images/img47.jpg" alt="Folklore in Cartagena" />
  <p>47- Folkloric dances, a living tradition of Cartagena: In the afternoons, the historic center of Cartagena transforms into a spectacle for those who visit, whether it’s for the colorful streaks that paint the sky at sunset, the colonial atmosphere, or the talent on display from urban artists, including the dancers who take over the squares and parks of the city. These performers captivate the audience with the traditions and folklore characteristic of the Caribbean region. Mapalé, Cumbia, Puya, Fandango, Porro, gaita rhythms, and other representative dances come to life as the sun begins to set. Plaza de La Paz and Parque de Bolívar become the perfect stage for the leading figures of coastal dance to showcase their steps to mostly foreign spectators. Percussion instruments, such as gaitas and various drums, create a festive atmosphere, accompanying each turn, gesture, and pirouette made by the dancers during their choreography. The costumes, suited to each dance, draw attention and complete the show, offering a high-quality experience. However, these dance performances go beyond mere entertainment for visitors: the dancers who share their talent in the squares of the historic center and sometimes in Getsemaní, are the ambassadors of an ancestral legacy passed down through generations.</p>
