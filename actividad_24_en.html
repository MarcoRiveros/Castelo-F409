  <h1>Activity 24: Old Shoes - Cartagena</h1>
  <img src="images/img24.jpg" alt="Ciudad Amurallada" />
  <p>24- The poet Luis Carlos López, nicknamed El Tuerto -the one-eyed-, in his poem «To My Native City», refers to old shoes as a symbol of love for the Walled City, and sculptor Héctor Lombana transformed that love into a monument that the people of Cartagena feel truly belongs to them. It’s a picturesque and curious sight for tourists, who excitedly rush to take a photo and capture a truly beautiful moment in a city that is synonymous with beauty. The Old Shoes Monument is located behind the San Felipe Castle, and thanks to its position, it is visited by many tourists who recognize in it an absolutely charming feature. Here we present the poem by Tuerto López that inspired the artwork: <br/><br/>To My Native City <br/> - Noble corner of my ancestors: nothing -Like wandering down winding alleys -Evokes the days of cross and sword, -Of smoky lanterns and little candles.-For your age of romance has passed, -Walled city... the caravels -Have forever left your bay...-No more oil comes in little jugs! -You were heroic in colonial times, -When your sons, noble eagles, -Were not a flock of swifts. -But today, full of antique disarray, -You can still inspire that same affection -One has for a pair of old shoes.</p>
