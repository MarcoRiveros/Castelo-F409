  <p>42- Monument to India Catalina: India Catalina, a beautiful indigenous princess, was kidnapped around 1509 by the Spanish conqueror Diego de Nicuesa. She was the niece of the main chiefs of the region. After her capture as a young girl, she was taken to Santo Domingo, where she adopted Spanish customs, habits, and religious beliefs, which she spread upon her return to the mainland around 1527. Catalina was a key figure in the beginning of mestizaje in the territories of Cartagena de Indias, as she was fluent in both Spanish and indigenous languages. She helped her lover, the Spanish Pedro de Heredia, in the founding of Cartagena. However, later on, Catalina rebelled against him, accusing him of stealing the region's gold.</p>
