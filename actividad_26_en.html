  <p>26-Discover the Magic of the Totumo Mud Volcano and Its Surroundings! Just a short drive from Cartagena, in the municipality of Santa Catalina (Bolívar), you’ll find one of the region’s most unique attractions: the Totumo Mud Volcano. This small, 20-meter-high natural formation offers a therapeutic mud bath inside its crater, which you can reach by climbing a rustic wooden staircase. Perfect for lovers of eco-tourism and wellness experiences, the site is easily accessible via National Route 90A, also known as the Via al Mar, which connects Cartagena to Barranquilla. Around the volcano, local vendors offer delicious traditional dishes, including fried fish, coconut rice, and refreshing tropical drinks. But the adventure doesn’t stop there—hop on a boat tour through the Totumo Lagoon, where you can explore the lush mangrove ecosystems and visit nearby islands like Los Cocos, La Fantasía, and Las Garzas, each teeming with local wildlife and natural beauty. A truly unforgettable getaway that combines nature, culture, and relaxation in a one-of-a-kind setting!</p>
