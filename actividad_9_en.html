  <p>9-In Cartagena, the iconic fruit vendors known as palenqueras are women from San Basilio de Palenque the first free town of formerly enslaved people in the Americas. True to tradition, they sell fresh fruit and local sweets in the streets, adding color and cultural richness to the city's atmosphere.Street vendors are an essential part of Cartagena’s daily life. You can find them everywhere in plazas, parks, along busy streets, and even on the beaches. They offer a wide range of products, from local food and snacks to handmade crafts and souvenirs. Known for their bargaining skills, these vendors are usually open to negotiating prices and often offer special deals to attract customers. Friendly and full of energy, they’re always willing to answer tourists’ questions — whether about their products or the city itself.</p>
