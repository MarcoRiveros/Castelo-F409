  <h1>Activity 33: Cartagena, an Ideal Beach Destination</h1>
  <img src="images/img33.jpg" alt="Beach" />
  <p>33- Beyond its rich cultural heritage within the historic walled city, Cartagena also shines as an ideal beach destination, with a stunning coastline along the Caribbean Sea. This unique blend has earned it a spot on prestigious lists like “Top 10 Destinations in South America” and “Best South American Cities to Visit.” Just 15 km from the historic center, you’ll find the peaceful Manzanillo Beach, located where the Ciénaga de la Virgen lagoon ends. It’s a wide, serene beach with calm waters and very few visitors — the perfect spot to relax, unwind, and enjoy nature in total tranquility.</p>
